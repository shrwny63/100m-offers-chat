# Heading: Full_Text (Part 57)
love to meet you and hear about your business and see if we can help. Would you be opposed to growing faster? If not... NEXT BOOK. You can check out my next book aptly named Acquisition.com Volume II Lead Generation. Which covers….lead generation. You’ll never run out of new customers if you follow the steps in that book (especially now armed with the offer we have built). Not sure if that’s the final name (it’s still in edits), but if you search for my name, you’ll find it. You’ll also likely be able to find it on my site Acquisition.com (hopefully). AUDIOBOOK. If you like listening and having all your books with you to reference (that’s what I do) you can grab the audible & kindle version of any or all my books on amazon. I like reading and listening at the same time to increase my absorption & consumption speeds. Just search for the book titles and they’ll both come up. PODCAST. If you like listening, I have a Podcast called “The Game” where you can tune in to short episodes that deliver tactical lessons (learned from failures) so you can get to your goals faster. Check the podcast out here: alexspodcast.com YOUTUBE. I have a Youtube channel with fresh tutorials a few times a week: just search my name “Alex Hormozi” to find it. IG. You can follow me on IG if you like the more personal stuff: @hormozi
