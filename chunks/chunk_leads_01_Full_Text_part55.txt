# Heading: Full_Text (Part 55)
then tell other people about it to get you leads. #2 Employees- people in your business that get you leads. #3 Agencies- businesses with services that get you leads. #4 Affiliates- businesses who tell their audiences about your stuff to get you leads. *All four lead getters let other people know about your stuff. In other words, all four are higher leverage than you doing it on your own. Once you do understand the four lead getters, you can build a lead getting machine for every company you start for the rest of your life. I’ll break down how I use all four lead getters. How each is different. How to work with them. When to use them. Best practices. And how to measure your progress along the way. At the end of this section, you will understand how to get other people to bring you more leads than you can possibly imagine. And since we already use the core four to get customers, let’s start with something we can do right now–get those customers to refer more customers. #1 Customer Referrals - Word of Mouth “The best source of new work, is the work on your desk” - Charlie Munger October 2019. Leila and I sat together on her parents’ living room couch. The one she watched movies on as a kid. The faded edges of the coffee table begged us to kick our feet up. We balanced laptops on our thighs. Extension cords snaked around the couch to outlets down the hall. Her stepmother clanged in the kitchen. This was not a work environment. But, we made due. Two years earlier, I lost everything and met her parents on the same weekend… Hey dad, I met this guy on the internet. He lost everything and has no money. But don’t worry, I quit my job and moved in with him to help with his next big business idea. By the way, can we crash here for a while?’ …Great first impression, Alex. But a lot had changed since then. We were multi-millionaires now. We made enough to buy her childhood home in cash. Every week. Leila reviewed reports from our department heads. Oh yeah, we had executives now, too. “Hey, sales numbers look a little soft this week.” she said. “Really? How many did we close?” “Fifteen. And sales started dipping last week too. Is there anything different on your end?” “I don't know. Let me check.” I logged into Facebook’s advertising portal. Red rejection notifications filled the screen. “Welp. That’ll do it” I said. “What? What happened?” “All the ads got shut off.” “Well…that’s a problem. When do you think you can get them back up?” “It’ll take a day or two to get a new campaign started.” I squinted at the screen. Something even more alarming jumped at me. Facebook rejected the ads two weeks ago. I acted like nothing was wrong. “So we closed 15 this week, and how many the week before?” I asked. “21” “Well, I’ve got good news and I’ve got bad news.” “Uhh…Ok…” “The bad news is…the ads got shut off two weeks ago, so that explains the dip. The good news is…our product is so good that we’re still doing $500,000 a week from word of mouth alone. “You ignored the ads for two weeks!?” She had oh no you didn’t written all over her face. I shrugged with a sheepish grin. “You still love me, right?” We busted out laughing at the absurdity of it all. Those two years were insane. The amount of money we were making didn't make sense. We didn’t comprehend how much until years later. We were just grateful to be doing this together, flaws and all. And this accidental stretch without running paid ads made something very clear: Our customers were telling their friends. **A few months later** I stood on stage and looked out over the 700+ gym owner audience. Everyone paid $42,000 to be there. All wore black “Gym Lord” t-shirts and stick-on mustaches. It. Was. Nuts. I was mid-presentation, explaining how excellent service generates leads through word of mouth. All the while, I obsessed over whether the money we made during two weeks without running paid ads was a fluke. Feeling confident, I paused the presentation. Time to find out: “Alright, just to show you how important this is, who here learned about Gym Launch from another gym owner? Raise your hand.” As soon as the words left my lips, I felt instant regret. What if no one raises their hand? What if our growth was all forced? I’m such an idiot. I looked around the room with my arm raised like a monkey. The room stood still. Oh no. Then…a few gym owners raised their hands. That doesn’t look great,
