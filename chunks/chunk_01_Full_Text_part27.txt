to the book page on amazon (or wherever you purchased this) and leave a review right on the page. PS - If you feel good about helping a faceless entrepreneur, you are my kind of people. I’m that much more excited to help you crush it in the coming chapters (you’ll love the tactics I’m about to go over). PPS - Life hack: if you introduce something valuable to someone, they associate that value with you. If you’d like goodwill directly from another entrepreneur - send this book their way. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming. - Your biggest fan, Alex 8 VALUE OFFER: THE THOUGHT PROCESS “If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again.” THOMAS H. PALMER, TEACHER’S MANUAL I want to do an exercise with you right now. I want to show you the difference between convergent and divergent problem solving. Why? So that you can actually create the Grand Slam Offer that will become the cornerstones of your business. Convergent & Divergent Thinking In simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known, with unchanging conditions and converge on a singular answer. Think math. Example: You have 3 salespeople who can each take 100 calls per month each. It takes 4 calls to create one sale (including no shows). You need to get to 110 sales . . . How many sales people must you hire? Deduced Information: 1 salesperson = 100 calls 4 calls = 1 close 100 calls/4 calls per close = 25 Closes Per 100 Calls 25 closes per rep Goal: 110 sales total / 25 sales per rep = 4.4 Since you can't hire 4.4 reps, you decide you must have five. ANSWER: And since you have 3, you hire two more. Math problems are convergent. There are lots of variables and a single answer. We are taught all our lives in school to think this way. That is because it’s easy to grade. But life will pay you for your ability to solve using a divergent thought process. In other words, think of many solutions to a single problem. Not only that, convergent answers are binary. They are either right or they are wrong. With divergent thinking, you can have multiple right answers, and one answer that is way more right than the others. Cool right? Here’s what life presents us for divergent thinking: Multiple Variables, Known & Unknown, Dynamic Conditions, Multiple Answers. As such, I want to do an exercise with you that will engage the part of your brain that you will need to use in order to make something magical. I call it the “brick” exercise. Don’t worry, it’ll only take 120 seconds. The Brick Exercise Right now, I want you to set a timer on your phone for 120 seconds. What you need to do: Think of a brick. Write down as many different uses of a brick as you can possibly think of. How many different ways could a brick be used in life to provide value. Ready? Go. It’s okay to write in the book. ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Alright — stop. Now before I show you my list, did you consider the following . . . . . . How big is the brick? A tab of gum, 3-5/8" x 2-1/4" x 8" (Standard), 2 ft x 2 ft x 6ft? . . . What is the brick made of? Plastic, Gold, Clay, Wood, Metal? . . . How is the brick shaped? Does it have holes in it? Does it have divots for interlocking? Now as you think about that, can you think of even more uses for the brick than you probably wrote down? Here’s my list: Paper weight Door stop Building things Home for a fish in a fish bowl Plant holder with dirt in the holes (holed brick) As a trophy (painted brick) Rustic decoration To break window Make a mural (tiny bricks painted) A weight for resistance training A wedge under uneven platform Pen holder (holed brick) Children’s toy (lego bricks) Floatation device (plastic brick) Payment for goods (gold brick) Stabilizer for leaning something against Retainer of value (gold brick) Holder for flagpole (holed brick) A seat (jumbo brick) Every offer has building blocks, the pieces that when combined make an offer irresistible. Our goal is to use a divergent thought process to think of as many easy ways to combine these elements to provide value. So if I were selling a brick, I would find out what my customer’s desire was, and then devise how many ways I could create value
