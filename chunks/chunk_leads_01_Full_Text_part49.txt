a credit card. And if we make more than the cost to get and fulfill the customer in the first thirty days, we square our balance. Now, we have zero debt and a new customer which we can keep profiting from forever. Then, we repeat the process. Money is no longer your bottleneck. This is the key to limitless scale. I repeat the same image above so you can reference it. Let’s see client financed acquisition in action: Say we have a $15 per month membership that costs us $5 to deliver. That leaves us $10 gross profit left over. ($15 membership) - ($5 cost) = $10 gross profit per month And let’s say our average member stays for ten months. That makes our lifetime gross profit $100. ($10 gross profit per month) x (10 months) = $100 LTGP. If the cost to get a customer is $30 (CAC = $30), we have a 3.3:1 LTGP : CAC ratio. ($100 LTGP) / ($30 CAC) = 3.3 LTGP / 1 CAC → 3.3:1 Our ads make money. Hooray. But wait…there’s a problem. You spent $30 in ads and only got $10 back. Ten bucks trickles in, one month at a time, until you finally break even…two. months. later. That’s tough! Make no mistake, you should 100% make that trade. But, now we have a cash flow problem. Here’s the way I fix it- I immediately sell them more stuff If I offer a $100 upsell (with 100% margins) that one in five new customers take. That adds $20 of gross profit per customer. ($100 upsell) /(5 customers) = $20 average upsell dollars per customer. This takes us from $10 to $30 in the first thirty days (our break-even window). The first purchase is $10. But now the average upsell adds $20. $10 + $20 = $30 gross profit per customer in less than 30 days. And since it costs $30 to acquire them, we break even. Great! $30 CAC - $30 cash collected within thirty days = free customers! Every $10 a month that comes in thereafter is “gravy.” Now, I can go get another customer while I keep collecting that $10 profit per month for the next nine months. This is how you print money. The things you can sell or upsell are unlimited. If I cover the cost to get and fulfill a customer in the first thirty days I can pay off my card, then do it again. It’s how I’ve scaled every company I’ve started for the past seven years past $1M/mo in the first twelve months - without outside funding. With efficiency out of the way, creativity is your only limit. Bottom Line: Figure out a way to get your customers to pay you back in the first thirty days so you can recycle your cash to get more customers. Personal Lessons from Paid Ads 1. Don’t Confuse Sales Problems With Advertising Problems. The cost to get customers doesn’t only come from advertising (it just mostly does)… For example, a company I invested in spent twelve weeks and $150,000 to run paid ads. They were getting the right leads on the phone, but they weren’t buying. The owner said advertising didn’t work. But the ads worked fine, great even, their sales sucked. The owner threw up his hands and gave up…six inches from gold. Frustrating. Confusing an advertising problem with a sales problem cost them an estimated ~$30M in enterprise value. If your engaged leads have the problem you solve and the money to spend, and they’re not buying, then your ads work fine–you have a sales problem. 2. Your Best Free Content Can Make The Best Paid Ads. Some of the best paid ads I’ve ever run came from free content. If you make a free content piece that generates sales, or performs very well, nine times out of ten it’ll make a great paid ad. a. User Generated Content (UGC). If you can get your customers to create testimonials or reviews using your product, post them. If they perform well as free content, they often make killer ads too. Having a system in place to encourage these public posts from customers is my favorite way of getting a steady stream of potential ads. And the best part is - it’s no extra work. 3. If You Say You Suck At Something, You Will Probably Suck At It. Never say “I’m not techy” or “I hate tech stuff.” It just keeps you poorer than you should be. I said it for… wait for it…FOUR YEARS. Then one day, I snapped because I hated my website designer more than I hated tech itself. “If this idiot can do it, so can I.” Four years of wasting time and lost money reversed with four hours of concentrated
